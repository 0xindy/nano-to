## Dataset

We actively encourage other developers to add [Nano.to Usernames](https://nano.to/known.json) to their apps. This makes your Nano address "findable by Username" on a growing list of applications & games. 

```pthon
https://nano.to/known.json
```

> If privacy is your thing, don't get a Username for a particular address, and avoid the publicity.
